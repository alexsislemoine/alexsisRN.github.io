<h1>About Farm of Feelings</h1>
<p>
Welcome to Farm of Feelings. This is a lively farm where children's emotions can visit
safely in gentle, caring places on the farm. 
</p>
<p>
Here feelings come and go; some arrive quietly, some stomp in, and some stay longer
than we expect.  
</p>
<p>
On this farm, every feeling is welcomed, understood, and allowed to leave, just as we
are free to leave a visit when it is time. No feeling is too big, too messy, or too much,
because feelings are visitor, not who we are.
